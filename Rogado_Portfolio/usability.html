 	<h1>Web Portfolio: Web</h1>

 	<p>Method - What website did you study? Who is the target audience? What three tasks did you assign to your subjects?</p>

 		<p>-I studied my portfolio, the target audience is anyone who wants to know about me as a web designer. I basically did a scavenger hunt, I made the person look for a certain picture, email me, and be able to go to the school's website. </p>

	   <p>Results - Were subjects able to complete the tasks you assigned them? Was it easy for them? How much time, or how many steps, did it take to complete the tasks?</p>

	    <p>-Yes, they were all able to complete al of the tasks. It was easy for them, it took them less than a two minutes to do it.</p>

	   <p>Discussion - What did you learn from this study about the website? Is the current design effective? Why or why not? How might the site be designed differently so that users could more easily perform the representative tasks?</p>

	   <p>-I learned that even if I think my own website is the way I like it, I should be able to think of other people as well. Make their lives simple annd help them get to where they want to go by a simple click. Have a good flow to the website would make it easier to perform the representative tasks. Make the website look more modern than it does right now. I can fix my errors as well.</p>
